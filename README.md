**This is all under construction!**

I know the optics of this GitHub are really rough, and I swear that I have been working on this for a while and have deleted much more text than I've written (yikes, I know); in fact, throughout my video presentations and discussion posts over the semester, you likely have *seen* the non-presented iterations of the project, or even just snippets as I click around my desktop while talking/recording.

Anyway, this is what I have for iteration 3 that is even *slightly* presentable. Granted, I'd tried several different visualizers recently, including the tools utilized in our classes, but the only one that seems to provide a web that I sort-of like is Kumu.io -- so I've imported one month of published content from the Holy Palmarian Church into it and just tried to map it out.

Yes, it is ugly. Yes, it is obtuse. Yes, it is concise. However, I'd hope to incorporate this into a larger website project (nothing crazy, maybe just a Carrd site) with lexias and hyperlinks that would expand on the most relevant topics.

Okay, so, **enough preamble! Time for some information!**
*The way to view this project is to examine the image of the information web after going through definitions and then cross-checking the web with the 'kumuexpanded.md' file.* (So far, there is only one expansion -- as the library is further tracked [and I move things over from the previous sites I was using but gave up on], it will get larger and more full).

So YES!
1. Engage with the 'projectdefinition.md'
2. Engage with 'churchdefinitions.md' AND 'kumuiteration3.png'
3. Use the 'kumuexpanded.md' file as a temporary broken-hyperlinked page by which you can access lexias that fill in the MOST revelatory information/doctrine/explanations from the info web.

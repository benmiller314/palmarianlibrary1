**Nick Canada's Reflection Letter**
*for DSAM 3000*


Oh boy, this is it: the final reflection. Much like my pieces of written feedback throughout the semester to my classmates, I have opted to use this space as a capstone for not only my project -- but for my Mindful Practice Journal as well. More specifically, the first iteration of a mindful practice journal.


**What's my project?**

My project is something that has undergone significant and transformative pruning throughout the semester. Initially, I wanted to do a large-scale ethnographic-style survey of all web-facing content that illustrated the interfacing of the Holy Palmarian Catholic Church with the general non-local public -- that quickly fell on its face. Instead, I opted for something much more centered and much more representative of my own through-lines of feedback to my colleagues (scope, and not the mouthwash). The Palmarian Church is a schismatic cult (defined using scholarship such as Seven Hassan's BITE model of authoritarian control) that split off from the Catholic church (in the inclusive sense of both Roman/Latin and Byzantine/Eastern) after two businessmen capitalized on a supposed Marian appearance. One, through generalized chicanery, was ordained a priest and declared himself the new and *true* pope. Ever since then, and through an intensely bizarre and generally harmful history of control and coercive rhetoric, those who are converts and are born into the cult have been restricted from any engagement with media of any type -- until very recently. The new scope of the project was to begin surveying and creating a site that can be a quick repository for the most important views into the religious order through TikTok -- the social media site that reaches the most young crowd and has generally the most engagement (I now hear that TikTok is likely to be shut down in the near future. I'm suspecting that my work at the beginning of DSAM 2 will be my retooling of my *direct* place of study, hopefully without sacrificing my *overarching* object of study).


**What were my digital tools/objects of study, and how did I try to use them?**

Other than just the TikTok accounts of the official head (See) of the church and some apologists, I attempted to grow in my understanding of GitHub, website publishing softwares/services, and Kumu.io. Although I am still struggling (just a little bit) with bringing everything together as well as I'd like to, I am slowly working on new and exciting ways to have my data presented in a visual, simple, and highly informative structure with hyperlink-filled lexias. In essence, these digital tools and my object of study helped me to conceive of launchpad by which others can use my introductory research/data to begin their own resource-hunting adventures.


**What happened in the course that I didn't expect -- and what didn't happen that I did expect?**

One thing that did not happen as I'd expected it to was, well, the end product of my project. Scope remains the theme of my look back on my journal -- and I can see how the project began already in a death spiral. I'd expected to be much further along, even with all of the medical junk and hospital visits that have plagued me in the past several months. I suspect that it is Sidra and Khushboo's fault -- and don't worry, I have and will continue to let them know that (lol). But, one thing that was comforting, in a way, in going through out semester is seeing how nearly everybody else in the class was also very likely surprised by shortened end-goals they all faced. And, this may seem silly, but one thing that I **did** happen and I didn't expect it was, well, not being as anxious about this stuff. Like I mentioned in my iteration 4 write-up and talk, I could see the disappearance of my panic as my journal continued onward to now.


**What feedback will continue to permeate my work on this project?**

As for feedback I'd want to remember moving forward into the next portion of DSAM (and into further research in general) are pieces that I both *gave* and *received* (since I think everybody had these things on their minds). These pieces of feedback were to limit scope wisely and to aim for relevant visuality. With a project like mine, it was extremely easy to draw corners around the whole world -- as I've explained above. And in that vein, it was easy for me to continuously work on journaling, note-taking, annotating, and material-gathering *without actually* pushing anything, or attempting to work with new tools (like Kumu, what I settled on -- for now).


**What next?**

In the vein of the previous segment, I think I'd need to continue moving with both scope and visuality in mind. Also, like I mentioned in the first bit of this reflection, I know that there is a high likelihood that TikTok may be disappearing. Remember when I mentioned how I wanted to save the content locally and some of the other students didn't initially understand why? Well, this is why. I fear that this exclusive and mysterious information will permanently go when TikTok does, so my project might shift into that preservative archive in DSAM 2. Maybe. Only time will tell, at least through mid-January.


**What writing have I done in previous weeks that feels most relevant to now?**

Although I've been paraphrasing bits from my MPJ (Mindful Practice Journal, which I'll now abbreviate) throughout the bulk of this reflection, I decided to go back through my general notes and Grok writing and find some buzzwords that reflected my perspective at the time of writing -- and how that perspective has shifted. For instance, in a page I've titled "notesweek3" (I assume this is from week 3) I have a scattered notepad document that considers one's ability to trace the contours on missing data. Reading these notes brings me back to my anxiety about establishing a hierarchy of **found** data and **usable** data in my own research. I also wrote about the secrecy of harvesting data, about the sheer intimacy where we navigate the line of what ought to be uncovered and what we can find through our aims at undiscovery. That feeling never really went away, that closeness to the subjects, however, I now can more clearly see how natural hierarchies occur *in* data and in our *weaving* of data -- without this, I would never have been able to make a legible visual document. Somewhat relatedly, I have in my week 6 notes significant writing on how I felt like modular coding knowledge is what can make me feel like I'm not drowning. Moreover, my ability to parse data, organize it into relevant hierarchies, feel comfortable working with the undiscovered and undiscoverable data, and to record it all through modular learning helped me to stay, well, as sane as possible.


**What inspired this project?**

Ben likely remembers that a meeting with him is what inspired this project. More broadly, though, I've always had an interest in belief systems, the rhetoric of faith, and the social import that religious communities offer -- especially those that don't actually act like major religions. The new age movement grips my attention nearly all of the time, as 'free thought' counterintuitively, yet fairly consistently, leads quickly to harmful patterns of control and authoritarianism. My relations to many major cults and cult-like organizations in the United States has exposed me to the currents of other organizations that are entering the light of modernity -- like the Palmarian Church. I'd known about them for some time, and planned to casually do this project on my own. Then, lo and behold, I realized I could use this course as a resource for this project and not do double the work.


**Some why and how questions from course engagement: Why is iteration important? Why is presentation to peers important? How can I be not answering my question and nevertheless succeeding in the context of this seminar?**

Iteration appears to be the mechanism that breaks people down to help them build things up better. Obviously, iteration in a non-DSAM class sense doesn't have to be so harsh -- yet it is, here. It's scary having to make a proper iterative push on something that feels so remarkably incomplete. How the sausage is made is something unexamined in most graduate courses -- which isn't a great thing, may I add. However, the fact that we have to present our iterations? Terrifying. And yet, it was the most helpful thing in the course. I began to feel safer, I began to feel like those around me wanted the project to be great -- and their efforts on their own projects elicited that same level of empathy and compassion. I felt compelled to write long feedback and silly preambles: not because they were required, but because I wanted to break the tension on such a process and to show my cohort that, yes, I really do think what they're working on is brilliant. Even in the moments of lack -- a lack of deliverables, a lack of answers, a lack of confidence -- I can see my progress move forward in both the videos that are linked in our discussion posts, my private notes, my MPJ, and the published notes, too. Iteration, the iteration presentations, and the acknowledgement of the value of *lack* were critical to my success, I believe.


**Did I not meet the forms of engagement?**

There are two-ish ways that I think I didn't meet the engagement requirements -- one, I missed class once and was a few minutes late a few other times. Being late is never fun, and I typically am pretty punctual, but morning chemo and then an immediate bus ride slowed me down much more than I was expecting. I plan on trying to work my non-work schedule a bit better for DSAM 2, as it was definitely embarrassing to be late to such a small class. The other requirement I missed (two) would be my lack of talking in a couple of classes. Again, despite me being a chatterbox most of the time, some days I really was not feeling mental clarity -- however, I adopted the role as the primary non-Ben note taker for the class in an attempt to offset my occasional lack of course room participation. A possible third one -- my presentations were never remarkably professional, but I aimed at them being honest and thorough with their information. Other than these, I feel like I was able to provide 4 question-answering iterations, I participated regularly in multiple capacities, I created a GitHub site where I bare all (and will bare even *more* all in DSAM 2), I spent time working on this class outside of the normal deliverables, **and** I may be the only person to do every single (non-optional) discussion post in the class (at least I think -- I completed all feedback, did reading discussion posts, introduction, other little stuff. This may be due to the fact that I assign discussion posts in my classes that I teach, so maybe I'm just more primed for remembering the rhythm of such assignments).


**What reading sources were impactful?**

Although we never got to talk about these readings as much as I'd wanted to, and although I didn't incorporate them into my projects as much as I could have, I remember our week 7 discussion on AI was one of my favorites. Although I don't have any direct quotes (in my notes I had a lot of bits on the Crawford piece "Excavating AI"), I remember us considering the problematic feedback loops of automatic data skimming, and how bad processes can get re-inserted back into a project/database and then learned from again. This was then tied into the problems found in AI image generation -- the silly articles illustrated it well, and I was able to contribute my chocolate chip cookie example as another way to think about problems in re-sorting bad data.


**How might I change my approach or application of my methods in the future?**

I think I've answered this throughout the previous sections, especially in regards to the pivot away from TikTok.


**What are some concrete next steps?**

I think I've also answered this question throughout the previous sections -- continue development over winter break, determine necessary pivot for DSAM 2 when the TikTok ban may or may not happen, and then continue using locally-saved data or just go fully into another form of media to preserve the hyperlink-lexia structure.


**What's my project write-up/README?**

I do have a readme for my project! So through that and other commentary notes, this question can be answered. This suggestion was mine, since I noticed some students had no readme.


**Final thoughts!**

I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would (not that I thought I would hate it, I was just more afraid). I ended up highly valuing all feedback and the support system I've gained through the last fifteen weeks or so, and I appreciate how accommodating everyone has been towards me especially-frazzled series of iterations and attempts at intelligent contribution.

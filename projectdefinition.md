**This project** aims to catalogue both engagement with and interest in the Palmarian Catholic Church on the social media platform TikTok.

**The aim** is to create some type of data set that may represent young people's interest in hyper-traditional orthodox belief, as purported by the appearance of "ortho-bros" and "trad" youth.

**The scope** is to focus on the main Palmarian Catholic Church main TikTok account that is officially managed by the organization. I intend on going through all posts on said page to try and accurately gauge audience metrics and general reactions to content posted.

**The purpose** is to provide commentary on the Palmarian Catholic Church's previously ultra-sercretive liturgical practices and general facets of the faith that have been, up until recently, entirely obscured. Another purpose is to grant insight into how cults and cult-like groups can bring young members in through both their methods and the audience's vulnerabilities/desires.

**Why TikTok?** In an effort to reach younger people who might be falling into a rightward and more conservative shift, the Palmarian Church seems to focus most of its internet outreach onto both TikTok and instagram. Specifically TikTok, though, has the youngest demographics out of many social media platforms, therefore, it makes the most sense to use it as a site to track engagement of younger people.

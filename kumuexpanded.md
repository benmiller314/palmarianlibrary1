**For the purposes of iteration 3, and a lot of trial and error that I've not recorded anywhere except my own little journal (I promise I am going to upload a timeline soon, sometime between this iteration and the next), I've decided to create a space that I, in the future, can hyperlink transcriptions, commentary, and facets of the overall visualized project that need a bit more textual clarification.**

Transcription:
"I just want to clarify the use of the Gestatorial Chair by Palmarian Pontiff. According to a traditional catholic encyclopedia, Pope Saint Pious II, more than 550 years ago, seems to have been the first pope to use a gestatorial chair because he suffered from the disease called gout. That means, more than 550 years of liturgical tradition in the church of Christ. Do not be shocked to see the true pope, his holiness Pope Peter III, following this holy tradition. Being above the faithful in a higher position, the faithful can see him, greet him, and receive his blessing. Ave Maria Purisima."
